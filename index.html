                    <p class="project-year">2021</p>

                    <p class="copy-section challenge"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Challenge:</span> Jordan’s recognized that their homepage experience was outdated & unresponsive. As the sole developer on the team at the time, I was tasked with wireframing, designing & developing a new homepage experience. Knowing the team had limited resources & a short turnaround time, I leaned on a simple yet effective tile-centric design. </p>
                    <p class="copy-section process"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Process:</span> I worked with our merchandising and analytics team to help determine which stories & categories should be featured. After getting this data, I spent time doing competitive research to see how other sites within our vertical display their collections. I used this information to put together a Figma design in order to gain final approval before beginning development.</p>
                    <p class="copy-section results"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Results:</span> The new homepage design launched in April of 2021 to coincide with the annual Red Sox promotion. The homepage redesign resulted in a lift in category & product views, decreased bounce rate, and a faster load time on mobile devices.</p>

                    <p class="project-year">2022</p>

                    <p class="copy-section challenge"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Challenge:</span> Similar to the homepage - the rest of Jordans.com was in need of a major facelift in order to stay modern & competitive. We fixed the homepage, but there was a lot more work to be done. </p>
                    <p class="copy-section process"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Process:</span> We worked with a design agency to help us wireframe and mockup every page from homepage to checkout. During development, we found ourselves re-working and re-imagining wireframes as certain obstacles and challenges arose. </p>
                    <p class="copy-section process">
                        At this point, I was the Senior Developer working alongside two other devs and a UX/UI designer. Together, we developed, QA’d and UAT tested every single page of Jordans.com. From the initial kick-off to the end of the project, only 11 months transpired. </p>
                    <p class="copy-section results"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Results:</span> We launched in February 2022 with minimal issues or set-backs. Since the launch, we have seen more organic traffic, lower bounce-rates site-wide and increased conversion & revenue. This was easily the most challenging but most rewarding project of my career.</p>
